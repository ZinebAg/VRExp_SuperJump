🕹️ Super Mario Bros – 2D Gameplay Definition
🎯 Core Concept
A 2D side-scrolling platform game where the player controls Mario, navigating through levels filled with terrain, enemies, and collectibles to reach the goal flag within a time limit.
⚙️ Game Loop
Start screen → level select → gameplay → goal/lose → next level or restart.
Win condition: reach the flagpole or castle at end of level.
Lose condition: health = 0 (enemy hit, pitfall, timeout).
🧍 Player (Mario)
Attribute	Description
Movement	2D horizontal side-scroll (X axis = move, Y axis = jump/fall)
Controls	← / → = move; Space / A = jump; Down = crouch; Shift / B = run
States	Small Mario (default), Super Mario (after Mushroom), Fire Mario (after Fire Flower), Invincible (after Star)
Physics	Gravity, friction, momentum. Jump = impulse force; collisions = AABB or pixel-perfect.
Health system	1 hit → lose power-up level → next hit = death.
🌍 Environment
Element	Description
Camera	Side-scrolling, follows player, fixed Y center.
Tileset	Grid-based world (16×16 or 32×32 px tiles). Platforms, pipes, bricks, question blocks, background.
Collision Layers	Solid tiles, pass-through tiles, interactive tiles (blocks, power-ups).
Boundaries	Player dies if Y < death limit (pit).
Scrolling	World scrolls right as player moves forward.
🧱 Objects
Type	Behavior
Blocks	May contain coins, power-ups, or nothing. Destroyable when Super Mario.
Coins	+1 coin → collect sound → 100 coins = 1 extra life.
Power-Ups	Mushroom → Super Mario; Fire Flower → Fire Mario; Star → invincible timer; 1-Up Mushroom → +1 life.
Flagpole	Level goal trigger; score based on height of touch.
👾 Enemies
Enemy	Behavior
Goomba	Walks straight, reverses on collision, dies when jumped on.
Koopa Troopa	Walks; stomp → shell mode; shell kicks on contact.
Piranha Plant	Moves vertically in/out of pipe; hurts on contact.
Bullet Bill / Lakitu / Bowser	Advanced types with projectile or pattern logic.
💥 Physics & Interaction Rules
Player → Enemy (top collision) = enemy defeated.
Enemy → Player (side collision) = damage or death.
Player → Power-Up = apply upgrade state.
Player → Coin = increment counter, play sound.
Player → Flag = trigger level complete sequence.
Gravity constant applied each frame; jump impulse = variable height based on press time.
🕰️ Game Systems
Score: awarded for enemy kills, coins, time remaining, flag height.
Timer: countdown per level (300 s default).
Lives: 3 default; 0 → game over screen.
HUD: shows score, coins, world, time, lives.
Audio: background music loop, sound FX (jump, coin, power-up, damage, flag).
🧩 Technical Specs
Aspect	Detail
Dimension	2D side-scrolling (camera follows X-axis).
Rendering	Canvas / WebGL / Pixi.js / Phaser 2D engine compatible.
Physics	Tile-based collision (AABB); gravity constant; jump impulse force.
Asset Structure	/sprites, /tilesets, /levels, /sounds, /scripts.
Level Format	JSON grid (tiles + objects layers + enemy spawn list).
Game State Machine	Title → Level → Win → Next Level / Lose → Restart.
🧠 AI & Patterns
Simple state machines per enemy (walk, turn, stomped, dead).
Collision triggers via bounding boxes.
Optional pathfinding or pattern loops for bosses.
🪄 Visual & Audio Style
Pixel-art sprites (16×16 or 32×32).
Parallax backgrounds optional.
Retro 8-bit/16-bit sound effects and music.
🚀 Extension Ideas
2-player mode (Mario & Luigi).
Level editor (JSON builder).
Save system (localStorage / backend API).
Physics enhancements (slopes, moving platforms).

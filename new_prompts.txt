Keep the file references consistent with other asset loads (this.load.audio(...)) and place new this.sound.play(...) calls at the appropriate events:

jump sound → in the section where velocity Y is set for jumping.

win sound → when the player reaches or collides with the goal/pole.

gameover sound → when the GameOver scene starts.

Make sure to keep the volume balanced and the code cleanly organized. Do not modify unrelated physics or HUD logic.¨






Currently, the player dies whenever colliding or touching an enemy.
I want to change this behavior to match the classic Mario-style stomp mechanic:

If the player collides with an enemy from above (the player’s bottom touches the enemy’s top, while the player is falling or has a downward velocity), the player should stomp and kill the enemy.

When this happens:

Play a small bounce animation or upward velocity boost for the player (like a jump rebound).

The enemy should disappear or play a short “squish” animation before being removed.

For all other collisions (side or bottom contact), the player still takes damage or dies, as before.

Antenna are invincible — the player can never stomp them; their collision logic remains unchanged.

Keep the rest of the game logic intact.

Add short comments in the code explaining where the stomp condition is checked.

Make sure the bounce feels natural (not too strong or too weak).

<Feature 1>

Goal: Implement a lives system with visible heart icons and loss rules.

Instructions:
•⁠  ⁠Add ⁠ gameState.lives = 3 ⁠ (reset in ⁠ startGame() ⁠).
•⁠  ⁠Use ⁠ img/heart.png ⁠ (max width 60px, maintain ratio) as the life icon.
•⁠  ⁠Display hearts at the *top-left corner*, spaced by 12px.

Life loss conditions:
•⁠  ⁠Lose 1 life when colliding with an *enemy from the side or bottom*.
•⁠  ⁠Lose 1 life when touching an *antenna*.
•⁠  ⁠Stomping an enemy from above does *not* cost a life.
•⁠  ⁠When lives reach *0*, trigger ⁠ gameOver() ⁠ and play the game over sound.

UX:
•⁠  ⁠On hit, briefly flash the player sprite and grant ~800ms invulnerability.
•⁠  ⁠Update the hearts in real-time in the HUD.

<Feature 2>

Goal: Replace all uses of the old Swiss flag image (img/flag.png) with the new Swisscom flag (img/swisscom_flag.png) everywhere in the project.


Instructions:
- Update every reference in the code that loads, preloads, or displays img/flag.png to use img/swisscom_flag.png instead.
- Do not change file paths, variable names, object names, or logic — only the image source.
- Keep all game mechanics, physics, animations, and positions exactly as they are.
- Make sure the new flag loads correctly both in the map (tile/object layer) and in any victory or level-end scenes.
- Double-check that the new flag is visible at the same size and position as the old one.
- Do not touch unrelated assets (hearts, enemies, antennas, etc.).


Acceptance criteria:
- The game runs exactly the same.
- The Swiss flag visuals are replaced everywhere by the new img/swisscom_flag.png.
- No missing references or console errors.
